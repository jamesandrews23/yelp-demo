# Yelp Demo
This demo will take a phone number as a paramater and will return reviews for the associated company in the form of JSON.

# Why search by phone?
To keep this demo simple, and the way Yelp's fusion API works, a business ID is required to retrieve reviews. A business ID can only be accquired by calling one of the available 
REST search endpoints. The phone search was the simplest choice and with the suggested phone number to use selects my favorite restaurant. 

# Yelp Reviews
Yelp's fusion API returns only 3 reviews [please see here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews)
